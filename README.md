# ApproxPi
Approximation of Pi using polygon technique in comparison with Eulers complex.

One of the earliest ways to approximate pi was to calculate the perimeter of a polygon enclosed by a circle.
In 265AD Lui Hui found a approximation with a 3072 sided polygon and in 480AD Zu Chongzhi used a 12288 sided polygon. 
We will attempt this calculation to get a precision of 16 digits of the number pi.
